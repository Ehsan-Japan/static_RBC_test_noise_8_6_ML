run_experiment.py — THE experiment, end to end, in one program.

    python run_experiment.py

Edit the SETTINGS below and run it.  Four stages, in order:

    STAGE 1  make the devices           (simulator; reused if already on disk)
    STAGE 2  the rays x points sweep    (train + score every budget)
    STAGE 3  results                    (budget_sweep.csv, loss curves,
                                         paper_figures/)
    STAGE 4  per-device analysis        (sample_<i>/ folders with figures
                                         and the ML model's evaluation.txt)

The question it answers: how many rays, at what ray resolution, does it take
to recover the transition lines?

This file is the settings and nothing else — the stages themselves live in
experiment_stages.py, one function each, so they can also be called
individually.  Single stages also exist as their own programs:
generate_ml_data.py (1), train_model.py / evaluate_model.py (one cell of 2),
make_figures.py / render_paper_figures.py (3),
render_test_sample_analysis.py (4).

WHERE THINGS GO — nothing an earlier run made is ever touched.

    runs/<timestamp>_experiment/
      config.json          every setting that produced this run
      budget_sweep.csv     one row per (rays, points) cell
      models/              one checkpoint per cell
      loss_curves/         training curves + models_info.json
      paper_figures/       publication figure gallery (.pdf + .png)
      sample_<i>/          STAGE 4 per-device analysis

    training_data/ml_*_n*_res*/    the devices     (outside the run: a pure
    grid_cache/                    the cut rays     function of the settings,
                                                    shared between runs)

config.json names the exact dataset folders, so a result is always traceable
to its devices.  Changing N_TRAIN, RESOLUTION or DISJOINT_INTERVALS changes
the folder name — a run can never silently inherit devices made under
different settings.

The sweep is a fair comparison because the architecture and every training
setting are constants in src/dqd/ml/ — only the measurement changes.
